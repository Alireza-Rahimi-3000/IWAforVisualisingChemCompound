# Implementing Interactive Web Applications to categorize FDA approved drugs that visualizing the chemical structure of the molecule along with their molecular properties to accelerate drug discovery process 
In essence this application will allow us to filter molecules by their molecular properties (Lipinski's descriptors consisting of molecular weight, solubility (LogP), number of hydrogen bond donors and number of hydrogen bond acceptors).

This project using compound dataset to display as a order by filtering the Particular chemical compound to use as computational 2D model to accelerate drug discovery prodecure.

To implement these codes we need python, to be exact we need streamlit library that allows us a use open-source data that turns our scripts into shareable, interactive web applications.

Chemical filters are crucial in drug discovery and can help remove nondrug-like compounds from our datasets. Here we are filtering by molecular weight, a criterion in Lipinskiâ€™s rule of five. While many filters are much more complicated, using criteria such as substructures, molecular weight is an excellent example for our demonstration.
